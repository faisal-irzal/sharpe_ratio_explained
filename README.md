# Sharpe Ratio Explained

The Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe and is used to help investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. Volatility is a measure of the price fluctuations of an asset or portfolio.

Subtracting the risk-free rate from the mean return allows an investor to better isolate the profits associated with risk-taking activities. The risk-free rate of return is the return on an investment with zero risk, meaning it's the return investors could expect for taking no risk. The yield for a U.S. Treasury bond, for example, could be used as the risk-free rate.

## Formula

Sharpe Ratio = (R<sub>p</sub> - R<sub>f</sub>) / &sigma;<sub>p</sub>

where,<br>
R<sub>p</sub> = return of portfolio <br>
R<sub>f</sub> = risk-free rate <br>
&sigma;<sub>p</sub> = standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return
