# Sharpe Ratio Explained

The Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe and is used to help investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. it is used when assessing the performance of investment management products and professionals. It consists of taking the excess return of the portfolio, relative to the risk-free rate, and dividing it by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess returns. Conceptually, what this provides is a measurement of the portfolio’s outperformance per unit of the portfolio’s volatility. All else being equal, portfolios with higher excess returns or lower volatility will show higher Sharpe Ratios, and vice-versa.

## Formula

Sharpe Ratio = (R<sub>p</sub> - R<sub>f</sub>) / &sigma;<sub>p</sub>

where,<br>
R<sub>p</sub> = return of portfolio <br>
R<sub>f</sub> = risk-free rate <br>
&sigma;<sub>p</sub> = standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return
